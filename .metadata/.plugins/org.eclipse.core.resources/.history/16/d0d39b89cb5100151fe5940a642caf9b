//When you make a class a child of an abstract class, you are making a strong statement about what
//that class is
//an interface can be more vauge, for example, have ID's in it, use it for people, cars, etc
//abstract, like this example, is all about machines..cars, camera, etc. More specific 
public class App {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		//we can do all this on these objects, because Machine has these setters set up
		//and the camera and car classes extends machine
		Camera cam1 = new Camera();
		
		cam1.setID(5);
		
		Car car1 = new Car();
		
		car1.setID(4);
		
		//runs all the methods in the run method, in the Machine class
		car1.run();
